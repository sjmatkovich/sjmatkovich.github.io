# A start to documenting my exploration of 'biological data science'

This is merely a first post to establish a personal blog, which also serves as a brief set of acknowledgments and future resources. Any stated opinions or recommendations are entirely my own, independent of professional affiliation.

Resources which were invaluable in getting this website and blog started were:

1.  The description of the Quarto system in Hadley Wickham's 2nd edition of [R for data science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/ "R for data science, 2nd edition")

2.  Excellent walk-through tutorials on establishing a [website](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/ "Creating Quarto websites (Samantha Csik)") and [blog](https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/#iii.-adding-a-blog-to-your-personal-quarto-website "Add a blog to a Quarto website (Samantha Csik)") with the Quarto system from [Samantha Csik](https://samanthacsik.github.io/ "Samantha Csik's website")

3.  Some of the official [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/ "Quarto documentation for websites")

For future enhancement and exploration, I'm looking forward to exploring:

-   The resources listed at the '[Awesome Quarto](https://github.com/mcanouil/awesome-quarto "Github repo with Quarto resources")' github repository

-   More of Samantha Csik's tutorials, specifically on [SASS/CSS website customization](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/customizing-quarto-websites/#/title-slide "Samantha Csik tutorial on SASS/CSS for Quarto")
