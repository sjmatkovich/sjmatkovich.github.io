# A few tentative steps beyond the R environment I know well

R was the first language in which I developed a level of proficiency and continues to be the major language I use for biological data science. The Bioconductor environment was the selling point for me.\

I've taken seriously the recommendations of several experts to become highly competent in one programming language before moving on to others, and knowing a little about a large number of languages only goes so far.\

Nonetheless, I've wanted to develop some ability in Python for a couple of reasons:\
\* One of the three major environments for single-cell / single-nucleus is Python-based (the [scverse](https://scverse.org/)), in contrast to the R-based [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/) and Bioconductor [SingleCellExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/) approaches\
\* Google has a [mini machine-learning course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course) that uses Python for its exercises. I'd like to take advantage of a quick refresher course such as this to update my learning from the ['Practical Machine Learning' module](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-machine-learning?specialization=jhu-data-science) of the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization on Coursera, which I took a few years ago.\

## Python

Just to get my feet wet with the essential syntax and structures, I found this introductory series on Kaggle to be very helpful: https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python

I'm going to supplement this with a couple of recommended prerequisites for Google's course: [NumPy](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/eng-edu/blob/main/ml/cc/exercises/numpy_ultraquick_tutorial.ipynb?utm_source=mlcc&utm_campaign=colab-external&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=mlcc-prework&hl=en) and [pandas](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/eng-edu/blob/main/ml/cc/exercises/pandas_dataframe_ultraquick_tutorial.ipynb?utm_source=mlcc&utm_campaign=colab-external&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=mlcc-prework&hl=en)

## Nextflow
