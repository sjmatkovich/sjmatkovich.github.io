    "text": "You are preparing differential gene expression calculations with the R/Bioconductor limma package (including RNA-sequencing extensions such as limma-voom). While limma offers empirical Bayes moderation of t-statistics (‘borrowing’ variance estimates across genes), you have a large number of individual samples or have other reasons to avoid this procedure.\n\n\n\nOmitting the eBayes step in the limma workflow means that t-statistics are not calculated, and the useful topTable function of the package to summarize differential expression calculations does not function.\nFor example (assuming that you have prepared a DGEList object d, a model formula design and a contrasts matrix contrasts.matrix), a typical workflow including empirical Bayes moderation would be as follows:\n\nv &lt;- voom(d, design, plot = T)\nvfit &lt;- lmFit(v, design)\nvfit_c &lt;- contrasts.fit(vfit, contrasts=contrast.matrix)\n\n# Empirical Bayes moderation\nvfit_eb &lt;- eBayes(vfit_c, 0.01) # estimating that 1% of genes are differentially expressed\n\nx &lt;- topTable(vfit_eb, number=Inf, coef=z, sort.by=\"none\")\n# z is the contrast of interest\n# No restrictions are placed on the output of topTable (number=Inf)\ndf &lt;- as.data.frame(x[,c(1:6)]) # to extract important columns\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative workflow which does not use empirical Bayes moderation and calculates t-statistics separately would be as follows:\n\nv &lt;- voom(d, design, plot = T)\nvfit &lt;- lmFit(v, design)\nvfit_c &lt;- contrasts.fit(vfit, contrasts=contrast.matrix)\n\nvfit_c$t &lt;- vfit_c$coef/vfit_c$stdev.unscaled/vfit_c$sigma\nvfit_c$p.value &lt;- 2 * pt(-abs(vfit_c$t), df = vfit_c$df.residual)\nvfit_c$lods &lt;- vfit_eb$lods\n# log-odds of differential expression:\n# this is not technically correct in this instance but permits the subsequent topTable function to work\n\nx &lt;- topTable(vfit_c, number=Inf, coef=z, sort.by=\"none\") # z is the contrast of interest\ndf &lt;- as.data.frame(x[,c(1:5)]) # this drops the B value (lods) from the output as it is not correct\n\nNote the last line of the second workflow, which drops the ‘dummy’ B value needed for topTable to work. This is a limitation of this workaround. I suspect the ‘dummy’ B value could be almost anything, but for convenience I extracted it from the initial, empirical Bayes-moderated vfit_eb object. Typically I am interested in parallel calculations with and without the empirical Bayes step.\n\n\n\nI discovered this workaround in Google and/or Stack Overflow searches in 2023 but did not carefully note its source. It may well have been suggested by one of the limma package authors.\nI have placed this same material in a gist"
