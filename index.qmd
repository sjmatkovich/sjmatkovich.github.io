**Welcome!**

I hold a Ph.D in biochemistry and molecular biology and currently work as a biological research scientist in drug discovery for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. One of my greatest interests outside my scientific career and the improvement of public health is making music on the piano in the Western classical tradition; a gateway to many other musical pursuits.
